            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            My research focuses on the development of hard-core systems tailored for emerging hardware
            platforms, such as resource-disaggregated datacenter.
            I am particularly interested in enhancing the performance of applications on these systems through the
            design and implementation of advanced programming models and compiler optimizations.

            <h3>Runtime for Disaggregated Memory</h3>
            As an emerging datacenter architecture, resource-disaggregation aims to reorganize datacenter hardware of
            each kind into their dedicated resource servers to improve resource utilization and fault tolerance and
            simplify hardware adoption. These servers are connected by advanced network fabrics a such as Infiniband and
            Intel Fabrics. As a result, the cloud application running on the resource-disaggregated cluster can get
            compute and memory resources from different servers.
            <br>
            I build a memory-disaggregated framework, Beehive, which improves the remote access throughput by
            exploiting the asynchrony within each thread. Beehive is capable of automatically converting applications
            into asynchronous execution code, which helps to reduce the microsecond-scale latency associated with remote
            memory access. This is achieved while maintaining low CPU overhead and enhancing data locality, leading to
            more efficient application performance.
